# HappyHorse by Ace Data Cloud for OpenCode

Native **OpenCode 2.0.26+** plugin: HappyHorse video tools and same-task results,
with a native `/connect` credential entry, hosted MCP and task Skill. It reuses
[HappyHorseMCP](https://github.com/AceDataCloud/HappyHorseMCP), not a duplicate API/billing client.
Independent Ace integration; not made or endorsed by HappyHorse or OpenCode.

## 1. Install the released plugin

Requires **OpenCode 2.0.26+**. Check `opencode --version`; OpenCode 1 has a different plugin API.
See [OpenCode's plugin manager](https://opencode.ai/v2/docs/plugins/).

The implementation is merged on `main`. Install through the official Git-package mechanism:

```bash
opencode plugin add github:AceDataCloud/HappyHorseOpenCode
```

For a fixed version, use the **v0.1.0** Git release:

```bash
opencode plugin add 'github:AceDataCloud/HappyHorseOpenCode#v0.1.0'
```

If your network cannot reach the HTTPS shortcut, the official Git SSH form uses your existing GitHub SSH access:

```bash
opencode plugin add 'git+ssh://git@github.com/AceDataCloud/HappyHorseOpenCode.git#v0.1.0'
```

[Release notes and source archive](https://github.com/AceDataCloud/HappyHorseOpenCode/releases/tag/v0.1.0).
Git release and npm publication are separate: npm availability is not claimed here.
The [OpenCode community-directory submission](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/56666)
remains under review and is not an endorsement or an in-product marketplace listing.
If you installed an earlier candidate target, remove that exact target with `opencode plugin remove`
before adding the released target. Install only one copy.

Installing registers **HappyHorse by Ace Data Cloud** as a native key/env connection,
a fixed hosted MCP server, and a task Skill. It does not select your chat model or authorize generation.

## 2. Register/sign in and get the right token

Open [Ace Applications](https://platform.acedata.cloud/console/applications?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=evergreen&utm_content=opencode_happyhorse_readme_key).
Find **General application**; choose **Initialize General Application** if needed.
Check HappyHorse access, balance and [current pricing](https://platform.acedata.cloud/models?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=evergreen&utm_content=opencode_happyhorse_readme_pricing).
Copy the API Key, or **Manage Keys → Create** a separate `OpenCode HappyHorse` key.

Review expiry, usage limit and **Allowed APIs**. For this basic workflow permit
`/happyhorse/videos` and `/happyhorse/tasks`. Advanced operations may require additional APIs.

Screenshots reused from the author-owned SunoDify tutorial commit
`8d3d03570e73324220f111f7fe343da0792a8071`, collected 2026-10-18. These are Ace account
screens, not OpenCode. The shown `Dify tutorial` name is a source example; use
`OpenCode HappyHorse`. Copy a raw token without `Bearer `, spaces or quotes. A
`platform-...` management token is not an application key. No trial amount is promised.

## 3. Paste in OpenCode

Reload the plugin, enter `/connect`, choose **HappyHorse by Ace Data Cloud →
Ace Data Cloud API Token — HappyHorse**, and paste the token. OpenCode stores it;
the plugin resolves it in memory for the fixed `happyhorse.mcp.acedata.cloud` destination.
Without a key the server remains disabled. Use `/mcp` to check its connection.
For env setup, export `ACEDATACLOUD_HAPPYHORSE_API_TOKEN` **to the server process**
before starting. Existing background services do not inherit another shell's env;
`opencode --standalone` provides an isolated first session.

## 4. First use and task results

```text
Use happyhorse_list_models to inspect current HappyHorse models. Do not generate any media.
```

Your chat model may bill for conversation even when no service generation runs.
After explicit price/budget approval, submit `happyhorse_generate_video` once. Preserve `task_id`.
Query `happyhorse_get_task(task_id=...)` with that same ID until the returned task confirms
success and final media URLs. Pending/processing or a preview link is not completion.
Never resubmit a generation to poll. No automatic paid retries or model fallback.
The existing MCP owns response normalization; inspect its current returned status.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Action |
|---|---|
| No entry | Verify OpenCode 2, exact plugin target and reload. |
| Disabled/401/403 | Check raw token, service access, expiry, restrictions and balance. |
| Pending | Query same task ID, do not generate again. |
| 429/5xx/timeout | Keep task/trace ID, inspect original status before new charge. |
| Existing same-name server | User configuration takes precedence; plugin does not overwrite it. |

Model chat and HappyHorse charges are separate. Installation/connection is not final
media, unique billing or customer-revenue proof. [Report a problem](https://github.com/AceDataCloud/HappyHorseOpenCode/issues).
